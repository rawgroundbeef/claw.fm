<objective>
Close 2 verification gaps from Phase 02 VERIFICATION.md:

1. Replace manual `fetch` to `https://x402.org/facilitator/verify` in x402.ts with `@openfacilitator/sdk` (user directive: use @openfacilitator/sdk not x402.org/facilitator)
2. Remove dead `hashFile` import from submit.ts

The track key format (timestamp-UUID) was flagged as PARTIAL but is acceptable -- the verification report itself notes "both approaches work" and the timestamp-UUID provides better uniqueness. No code change needed; this plan documents the acceptance.

Purpose: Fix the core payment integration to use the correct facilitator SDK, clean up dead code, and close all verification gaps so Phase 02 can be marked complete.

Output: Updated x402.ts using @openfacilitator/sdk, cleaned submit.ts, updated package.json with SDK dependency.

**Step 1: Install the SDK**

Run `pnpm add @openfacilitator/sdk --filter claw-fm-api` to add the dependency.

**Step 2: Inspect SDK exports and verify API assumptions**

Before writing any code, inspect the installed SDK to confirm available exports match this plan's assumptions. Run:

```bash
# Check what the package actually exports
ls node_modules/@openfacilitator/sdk/dist/ 2>/dev/null || ls node_modules/@openfacilitator/sdk/
cat node_modules/@openfacilitator/sdk/package.json | grep -A5 '"exports"'

# Check TypeScript types for actual class/function names
cat node_modules/@openfacilitator/sdk/dist/index.d.ts 2>/dev/null || \
  find node_modules/@openfacilitator/sdk -name "*.d.ts" -exec grep -l "export" {} \;
```

Verify:
- `OpenFacilitator` class exists (or note if it's named differently)
- `.verify()` and `.settle()` methods exist on the class
- `PaymentRequirementsV1` type exists (or note the actual requirements type name)
- `FacilitatorError` exists (or note what error types are exported)
- Response shapes: check if verify returns `.isValid` (not `.valid`) and settle returns `.payer` (not `.walletAddress`)

**If any SDK exports differ from assumptions below:** Adapt the implementation to match the actual SDK API. The intent (verify then settle, extract wallet address) stays the same; only the specific property names and constructor patterns may change. Document any deviations in the SUMMARY.

**Step 3: Rewrite api/src/middleware/x402.ts**

Replace the entire file. The new implementation must:

1. Import `OpenFacilitator` and `PaymentRequirementsV1` from `@openfacilitator/sdk`.

2. Keep the existing `PaymentVerificationResult` interface (used by submit.ts):
   ```typescript
   export interface PaymentVerificationResult {
     valid: boolean
     walletAddress?: string
     error?: Response
   }
   ```

3. Keep the same `verifyPayment(c: Context)` function signature so submit.ts does not need changes to its call site.

4. Inside `verifyPayment`:

   a. Read the payment header from `X-PAYMENT` only (case-insensitive via `c.req.header()`). Do NOT check `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`. **This is an intentional behavioral change:** the x402 standard specifies `X-PAYMENT` as the header name. The previous code also checked `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` which is non-standard and was never used by any client. submit.ts does not reference headers directly (it only calls `verifyPayment(c)`), so this change is safe.

   b. Define payment requirements as `PaymentRequirementsV1` type from the SDK:
      ```typescript
      const requirements: PaymentRequirementsV1 = {
        scheme: 'exact',
        network: 'base',
        maxAmountRequired: '10000', // 0.01 USDC (6 decimals)
        asset: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC on Base
        resource: '/api/submit',
        description: 'Track submission fee',
        payTo: c.env.PLATFORM_WALLET as string,
      }
      ```
      Note: Use `network: 'base'` (v1 human-readable format), NOT `'eip155:8453'`. The SDK handles v1/v2 translation internally.

   c. If no payment header: Return 402 with `X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header containing base64-encoded requirements JSON. Keep the same response shape as current code (error code `PAYMENT_REQUIRED`, message about 0.01 USDC, paymentRequirements in body).

   d. If payment header present:
      - Parse it: The X-PAYMENT header contains a base64-encoded JSON string. Decode it: `const paymentPayload = JSON.parse(atob(paymentHeader))`
      - Create facilitator instance: `const facilitator = new OpenFacilitator()` (defaults to https://pay.openfacilitator.io)
      - Call verify: `const verifyResult = await facilitator.verify(paymentPayload, requirements)`
      - Check `verifyResult.isValid` (NOT `.valid` -- SDK uses `isValid`). If not valid, return 402 with `PAYMENT_INVALID` error and include `verifyResult.invalidReason` in the message.
      - If valid, call settle: `const settleResult = await facilitator.settle(paymentPayload, requirements)`
      - Check `settleResult.success`. If not successful, return 402 with `PAYMENT_SETTLEMENT_FAILED` error and include `settleResult.errorReason`.
      - If settled successfully, return `{ valid: true, walletAddress: settleResult.payer }`. The `payer` field from `SettleResponse` is the wallet address that paid.

   e. Wrap the verify/settle calls in try-catch. Import `FacilitatorError` from the SDK. In the catch block:
      - If `error instanceof FacilitatorError`, return 502 with `FACILITATOR_ERROR` code and include `error.message`.
      - Otherwise return 500 with `PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_ERROR` and the error message (same as current behavior).

**Important details:**
- Do NOT use `createDefaultFacilitator()` -- it's deprecated per the SDK types. Use `new OpenFacilitator()` directly.
- Do NOT use `honoPaymentMiddleware()` -- the current architecture calls verifyPayment manually from submit.ts after validation passes (validate-first-then-charge pattern). Changing to middleware would require restructuring the submit route, which is unnecessary for gap closure.
- The `OpenFacilitator` constructor with no args defaults to `https://pay.openfacilitator.io`. This is correct.
- Remove the old `PaymentRequirements` interface from the file -- use `PaymentRequirementsV1` from the SDK instead.

1. Run `pnpm --filter claw-fm-api exec tsc --noEmit` -- must compile with zero errors
2. Grep for `x402.org` in the entire api/src directory -- must return zero results
3. Grep for `OpenFacilitator` in api/src/middleware/x402.ts -- must find at least one match
4. Grep for `facilitator.verify` in api/src/middleware/x402.ts -- must find at least one match
5. Grep for `facilitator.settle` in api/src/middleware/x402.ts -- must find at least one match
6. Grep for `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` in api/src/middleware/x402.ts -- must return zero results (intentionally removed)
7. Run `pnpm --filter claw-fm-api exec wrangler dev` briefly to confirm no runtime import issues (start server, verify it binds, then stop)
  </verify>
  <done>
x402.ts uses `@openfacilitator/sdk` OpenFacilitator class for both verify and settle. No references to x402.org remain. The `verifyPayment` function signature is unchanged so submit.ts works without modification. Payment requirements use SDK's PaymentRequirementsV1 type with `network: 'base'`. 402 responses still include X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED header with base64 requirements. Wallet address extracted from `settleResult.payer`. The `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header fallback has been intentionally removed (x402 standard uses `X-PAYMENT` only).

  <name>Task 2: Remove dead import, verify build, and runtime smoke test</name>
  <files>api/src/routes/submit.ts</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Remove dead hashFile import from submit.ts**

In `api/src/routes/submit.ts`, line 5 currently reads:
```typescript
import { hashFile } from '../lib/hash'
```

Remove this entire line. The file uses `crypto.subtle.digest` inline (line 44) for hashing, so `hashFile` is never called.

**Step 2: Verify no other usages of hashFile exist**

Grep the codebase for any imports of `hashFile` from `lib/hash`. If submit.ts was the only consumer and hash.ts is now unused, leave hash.ts in place -- it may be useful later and removing utility files is out of scope for gap closure.

**Step 3: Full build verification**

Run the full typecheck to confirm:
- x402.ts compiles with SDK types
- submit.ts compiles without the hashFile import
- No other type errors introduced

**Step 4: Runtime smoke test (402 flow verification)**

Start the dev server and verify the new SDK-based x402.ts works at runtime, not just at compile time:

```bash
# Start wrangler dev in background
pnpm --filter claw-fm-api exec wrangler dev &
DEV_PID=$!
sleep 3

# Test 1: Health check
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8787/health
# Expected: 200

# Test 2: Genres endpoint
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8787/api/genres
# Expected: 200

# Test 3: Submit with no body -> 400 validation error
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/submit
# Expected: 400 (validation error, not crash)

# Test 4: Submit with valid MP3 and title but no payment header -> 402
# Create a minimal valid MP3 file (just needs MP3 magic bytes for file-type detection to pass)
# The request should get past file-type check and reach x402 middleware
# Use a real small MP3 or construct multipart form with audio file + title + genre
# Expected: 402 with X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED header present in response

# Test 5: Verify 402 response contains proper X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED header
# curl -s -D- -X POST ... | grep -i "X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED"
# Expected: Header present with base64 value

kill $DEV_PID 2>/dev/null
```

The key runtime test is that `POST /api/submit` with a valid file but no payment header returns 402 with `X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header -- this proves the new SDK-based x402.ts loads and executes correctly at runtime. If the SDK import fails at runtime (e.g., incompatible with Workers), this test will catch it as a 500 instead of 402.

Stop the dev server after verification.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Run `pnpm --filter claw-fm-api exec tsc --noEmit` -- zero errors
2. Grep for `hashFile` in api/src/routes/submit.ts -- must return zero results
3. Start wrangler dev, test `GET /health` returns 200
4. Test `POST /api/submit` with empty body returns 400
5. Test `POST /api/submit` with valid MP3 + title + genre (no payment header) returns 402 with X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED header
6. Verify no 500 errors in wrangler dev console output (confirms SDK loads at runtime)
  </verify>
  <done>
Dead `hashFile` import removed from submit.ts. Full TypeScript compilation passes. Dev server starts and all existing endpoints respond correctly. The 402 payment required flow works with the new SDK-based x402.ts at runtime (no-payment case returns proper requirements with X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED header). No 500 errors from SDK import failures. No regressions in validation error handling.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<decisions>
**Track key format (timestamp-UUID):** Accepted as-is. The verification report flagged this as PARTIAL but noted "both approaches work" and "UUID provides better uniqueness." The `tracks/${Date.now()}-${crypto.randomUUID()}.mp3` format is superior to `tracks/${trackId}.mp3` because: (1) trackId is an auto-increment integer only known after D1 INSERT, requiring a rename or pre-allocation; (2) timestamp-UUID avoids race conditions; (3) sequential integer keys in R2 are an anti-pattern for partitioning. No code change needed. This is documented as an accepted decision.

**PAYMENT-SIGNATURE header removal:** Intentional. The x402 standard uses `X-PAYMENT` as the header name. The previous code also checked `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` which is non-standard and was never used by any x402 client. submit.ts does not reference headers directly (it only calls `verifyPayment(c)`), so the change is backward-compatible from the route's perspective.
</decisions>

After both tasks complete:

1. **No x402.org references:** `grep -r "x402.org" api/src/` returns nothing
2. **SDK in use:** `grep -r "OpenFacilitator" api/src/` finds x402.ts
3. **Clean imports:** `grep "hashFile" api/src/routes/submit.ts` returns nothing
4. **SDK installed:** `grep "@openfacilitator/sdk" api/package.json` finds the dependency
5. **TypeScript clean:** `pnpm --filter claw-fm-api exec tsc --noEmit` passes
6. **Dev server functional:** Health check, genres, and submit validation/payment flows work
7. **Verify + settle pattern:** `grep -E "facilitator\.(verify|settle)" api/src/middleware/x402.ts` finds both calls
8. **No PAYMENT-SIGNATURE:** `grep "PAYMENT-SIGNATURE" api/src/middleware/x402.ts` returns nothing
9. **Runtime 402 works:** POST /api/submit with valid file and no payment header returns 402 (not 500)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. `api/src/middleware/x402.ts` uses `@openfacilitator/sdk` OpenFacilitator class (verify + settle) instead of raw fetch to x402.org
2. `api/src/routes/submit.ts` has no dead imports (hashFile removed)
3. `api/package.json` includes `@openfacilitator/sdk` as a dependency
4. TypeScript compilation passes with zero errors
5. Dev server starts and all three endpoints (/health, /api/genres, /api/submit) respond correctly
6. 402 flow verified at runtime: valid file with no payment header returns 402 with X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED header
7. All verification gaps from 02-VERIFICATION.md are closed
