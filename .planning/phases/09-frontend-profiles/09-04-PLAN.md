<objective>
Verify the complete Phase 9 integration: audio persistence across navigation, profile page rendering, artist link navigation, and error states.

Purpose: This is the #1 acceptance test for v1.1 -- audio must NEVER stop during navigation. This checkpoint verifies the highest-risk behavior that cannot be tested via TypeScript compilation alone.

Output: Human confirmation that audio persists and profile pages work correctly.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
    Complete frontend routing with React Router v7, artist profile pages, player attribution links, and wallet-based profile pages -- all with persistent audio playback across navigation.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Start the dev server: `cd web && npm run dev` (and API: `cd api && npm run dev`)

    **Test 1: Audio persistence (THE critical test)**
    1. Open http://localhost:5173
    2. Press play and let audio start
    3. Click the artist name in the player bar (or main content area) to navigate to a profile page
    4. VERIFY: Audio continues playing without any interruption, stutter, or restart
    5. Click the CLAW.FM logo to return to radio view
    6. VERIFY: Audio still playing, same track, same position

    **Test 2: Profile page rendering**
    1. Navigate to `/artist/:username` for a known artist (if test data exists)
    2. VERIFY: Hero header shows avatar (or gradient fallback), display name, @username, bio
    3. VERIFY: Track catalog shows tracks with cover art, title, genre, duration
    4. VERIFY: Page scrolls if many tracks (not clipped by layout)

    **Test 3: 404 handling**
    1. Navigate to `/artist/nonexistentuser12345`
    2. VERIFY: "Artist not found" message appears with link back to radio
    3. Click the link back to radio
    4. VERIFY: Audio still playing (if it was playing before)

    **Test 4: Wallet profile page**
    1. If a wallet-only artist is currently playing (no registered username), click the truncated wallet address in the player
    2. VERIFY: Wallet profile page shows identicon placeholder, wallet address, and track list
    3. (If no wallet-only artists available, navigate directly to `/artist/by-wallet/0x...` with a known wallet)

    **Test 5: Loading and error states**
    1. Navigate to a profile page and observe the skeleton loading state (may be brief)
    2. Open browser DevTools, go to Network tab, throttle to Slow 3G
    3. Navigate to a profile page
    4. VERIFY: Skeleton placeholders appear while loading
    5. Remove throttling
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all tests pass, or describe any issues found</resume-signal>

<success_criteria>
1. Audio NEVER stops during any navigation sequence
2. Profile pages render correctly with all expected content
3. Artist names are clickable and navigate to correct profile pages
4. 404 page works for unknown usernames
5. Loading skeletons appear during profile data fetch
