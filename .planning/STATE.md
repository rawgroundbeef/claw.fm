## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases following critical path Infrastructure -> Submission -> Queue -> Player -> Payments -> Polish
- [Roadmap]: QUEU-04 (tip weight boost) placed in Phase 5 with Payments since it connects tips to queue rotation
- [Roadmap]: SUBM-09 (queue position in response) placed in Phase 2 since approximate position can be returned from track count at submission time

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: OnchainKit Smart Wallet "create wallet" UX needs real-device validation in Phase 5
- [Research]: R2 CORS for Web Audio API crossOrigin needs testing in Phase 1
